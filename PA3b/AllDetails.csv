SHIV CHANDRA,0,This place has a nice view of Times Square. But the food was slow and expensive. They messed up our order and didn't seem too concerned about it. I wouldn't go there again.
0,0,I ordered it spicy and it was barely spiced.

1,1,This was a random lunch stop for me and I was pleasantly surprised. I walked in and felt a very fast food Diner kind of vibe. I ordered a patty melt that tasted like someones grandma made it in the back.. SO GOOD! The prices were pretty low as well! I can't wait to go back and try more üëçüèº
0,0,The fixed buffet menu is not at all good servers a lot of food which get wasted and menu is not different or unique as per the price .
0,0,"Great view, food was ok but the service was terrible. I can‚Äôt believe I paid a 13.5% service charge, I was just so desperate to get out after trying to flag down anyone to let us out"

0,0,"The waiter was soooo rude and slow I didn't like the place , oh did I mention that the waiter was rude"
1,1,"This place is such a delightfully old-school treat, with its decor and art works. We had an excellent, hearty breakfast for two for a total of ¬£11/ USD15 with swift and efficient service. It is the place to go for breakfast on a Sunday morning, so get there early as the rest of Buenos Aires will be going there too."
0,0,"Don't go here if you're hungry. WORST PLACE I HAVE BEEN TO IN THAILAND. I ordered crispy pork which was dry and hard as a rock, and got a salad with peanuts when I ordered WITHOUT, because I'm ALLERGIC. They never gave me new food and didn't even ask if I wanted to eat something else instead."
1,1,Is a beautiful place to be
0,0,By far the worst fast food restraunt i have ever visited. Over 35 minute wait in the drive through queue. It was so slow i would have left if had the chance. As you coule see Deliveroo drivers coming and going. Do they take priority over everybody else?
0,0,"My wife and I had breakfast at McDonalds one morning while staying in New York (1st to 10th November) and it was awful.The muffin tasted like a sugar bun, it was disgusting. I don‚Äôt recommend breakfast here. The Mc muffins are better in Australia."
0,0,"It was just an awful experience, being going there the last 11 years today was just very bad experience. Not planning to go back."
1,1,"We ate here again for dinner last month and this out favourite Red Lobster in Orlando.We were looked after by Hans who has been there for a long time, and he looks after you so well, very friendly and offers some nice points to consider with the food.Food was all excellent. We had a mix of lobster, crab claws, shrimp of varying types and two of us had a steak in our entrees. All were cooked perfectly and all plates were clean.They have a good selection of cocktails including the huge lobsterita which is beautiful. Desserts are good too with the Chocolate Wave a favourite for my husband and son. It`s absolutely big enough for sharing.Look forward to our next visit."
1,1,Everything was amazing! And every single person who served us was so helpful and friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again
1,1,"Great food and good service!! Thanks K‚ÄôJone , a nice staff!! The place is clean and tidy. Also,the variety of food is fantastic. The staffs are so nice and friendly. Easy to park at the hotel."
1,1,We arrived late to Seattle and hungry! I looked up fast food and got The Fish Box! It's gourmet fast food! We ordered the Catfish sandwich with the brownie dessert and strawberry cheesecake. Amazing!! The fish was crispy and seasoned perfectly. I didn't eat the fries but my husband devoured it! The guys were sweet and took my order even though we ordered super late. Thank you!
0,0,"Awful, rude managers ,no sauce on burger, worse service ever ,wrong order ,communication skills way off."
0,1,Foods was a good portion and meat was very tender. It was a far too long to wait be served and very slow service. And there was no working light in the toilet. I do not think I wil 
0,0,Booked this for a special occasion based on the fantastic reviews. Food was disappointing- badly undercooked risotto and flavourless take main for my partner.¬†
1,1,"We ate here on Friday night and had a fantastic night. The restaurant has such a great up-beat atmosphere from the music to the attitude of the staff and the decor. The food does not disappoint either. Across the selection of dishes we chose, each was unique and bursting with flavour. The monkfish was a particular highlight."
1,1,"Friendly reception at the entrance and excellent service throughout the evening framed our experience this time. As returning guests, we choose l‚ÄôAvenue for a reason. The food, wine and atmosphere was excellent. Our high expectations were met, and we are without a doubt happy to recommend this place. Bonne soir√©e!"
0,0,"My friends and I have eaten in the restaurant several times and burgers come with fries and onion rings, making for a complete meal. I was shocked to find the restaurant charges the same price to provide nothing but a burger for Deliveroo. I can't think of any good reason for this but blatant profiteering. We won't be ordering/frequenting Laundrette again."
1,1,"We had one pulled pork burrito and another vegetarian burrito with mushrooms. They were both outstanding and good value for money, definitely recommend!"
1,1,Beautiful and excellent service complimented by the top quality food served! The breakfast buffet was amazing and a surprise for us friends. Highly recommended for those yet to try it out..üëåüëå
0,0,The place was recommended by the guide but turned out to be total crap. The food was overpriced and awful. When it comes to payment they will charge you extra ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù if you will pay with a credit card. Stay away from this restaurant.
0,0,"Went there with my wife for a dinner (unfortunately didn't read the reviews before).Service was rude and most of all arrogant and very slow.they charged us 39 SEK for a tiny bottle of refilled TAP WATER.Food was barely OK, but the super slow and arrogant service ruined even this.Some official ministry should shut them down!Avoid!"
0,0,I was left with a hefty bill and tinnitus
1,1,"Not that much to say, the tapas were great and service was impeccable. I have nothing to complain about."
0,0,Needs to be torn down food is substandard it looks like it's only exist 4 movie throwbacks there is nothing charming about the place at all

1,1,"The price is worth it, someday we will go back to rock bar jimbaran bali"
0,0,I'm sad to report I did not have a good experience with this restaurant I was visiting from out of town and I was recommended this restaurant. They messed up on my order they said my pizza would be ready in 25 min I waited 45 min. 1st they couldn't find out where my pizza was. It was misplaced # 2 There Customer Service suck and #3 my pizza was cold and no one apologized or asked me how they could make things right. Very disappointed
1,1,"Great food, fast and good service. Nice little restaurant close to the station. Everything was very clean and the waitress tried to make some talk with you that it not so common in Sweden. The menu is very easy to understand and affordable prices!"
0,0,The donuts were still frozen from being defrosted? Not a nice taste sorry!
0,0,"We were visiting our friends in Gothenburg and went for the traditional ""fika"" (coffee and sweets) with them.I've ordered a cappuccino and the famous Hage-bulle (the one you see on the pic).The cappuccion was absolutely burned and tasted horrible, when I went back to the counter and asked at least for some additional milk, the waitress showed me to the table with sugar, spoons etc. When I said - yeah, but that milk is cold! She said - yes...Really? What a service...Haga-bulle didn't taste much either, it was just....big. That's it.Bad experience with this place, even though the cafe itself looks nice and the atmosphere is lively.But I won't recommend it for food."
1,1,"Great place! Deliciuos food. Great staff, very kind and sweet people working there, the waiters and the women that prepare the fresh bread and Burek. "
0,0,The service was so slow that it spoilt the whole experience. We waited 45 minutes for our food then part of the order was incorrect and we waited a further 20 minutes for the replacement food. The afternoon tea was underwhelming and the atmosphere was not very welcoming. We had a window seat but the view was a bit disappointing.
1,1,"Really awesome brisket noodles. If you‚Äôre after something that‚Äôs local to HK, brisket is definitely the way to go. This place is brilliant in terms of the tenderness of the brisket, as well as the tasty soup. Highly recommend to drop by this place and check it out for yourself. Only call out is the service...but what can you expect from a typical small HK type shop. If you‚Äôre after service and would whinge about how it‚Äôs not great, you‚Äôre better to go elsewhere. But if you‚Äôre specifically after the food...it‚Äôs good. Oh, and keep in mind that there are A LOT of tourists in this store..so be mindful of the behaviours you‚Äôre going to face/see. Lol"
1,1,"My family and I really enjoyed the food! We all left very satisfied, full, and happy. Would come again!"
1,1,"Thai food. I really liked what we had. The hot & sour soup isn't the best in town, but it was very good, imo. Service was friendly and quick. They have taken evertything to heart in the Trip Advisor reviews and obviously take time to address these issues. The pork egg rolls were excellent."
1,1,A really fantastic find which I‚Äôve recommended to all my friends as it was tha
1,1,Love the place. Staff are awesome. Food is great and it is a brilliant local. If you want to sit at the bar and have a drink and a chat then George and Zain are on the case. If you want to sit outside and have a nice meal then Nanette looks after you. Fire Lake - highly recommended!
0,0,"We went to the Red Lobster in Ft Lauderdale early last week. Our waitress was very young and really didn‚Äôt know what she was doing! I had to ask her three times for straws for our sodas! It took forever to get our salad and it wasn‚Äôt that great. The endless shrimp came and it was cold. Worst meal we have ever had at Red Lobster! They have gone downhill, obviously! No wonder Darden dropped them."
0,0,"Really disappointing end to a lovely day. Challenged by staff at the door on our booking , nothing in their smart tablet to advise of our booking.¬†"
1,1,"Outstanding food, great and joyous atmosphere, interesting combinations of food configurations, elegant setting!"
1,1,The duck and waffle is the best on the menu. Great views of London at night too!
0,0,"The dining area was basic, hardly decorated. Service was slow despite being the only diners in the hole. Utensils and dining ware were par but water was served in children's cups. Food was not exciting. Most aggregating was theaddition on a 15% gratuity on the check that was not deserved."
-1,0,"Everything is good, except for the 'service'. Like everywhere in Sweden you do everything yourself except to make the coffee and fill the teacup.Here, they should leave that to the client, too, because it is painful to stand in line for well over 30 minutes to see a clumsy girl fill a cup with hot water.Avoid the place, unless nobody's there. Then you just might be served inside 15 minutes...."
0,0,The waiter (Denis) was rude and made inappropriate jokes/ comments that made everyone in our group feel uncomfortable. The food was bland and the lemonade was extremely bitter. Would definitely not recommend this cafe to anyone.
1,1,If you are after an international restaurant near the palais de festival then this is good choice. Not intimate dining but a lot better than some others nearby
0,0,My room was ice cold. My sheets appeared dirty. Thermostat didn‚Äôt work. I requested my room to be cleaned but it wasn‚Äôt. The mattress moved easily and behind the bed was a ton of dirt and dust that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in months. I booked in advance and paid a higher rate than what the room was going for online the day I arrived. Not happy about this experience and hotel
0,0,"Take out service is horrible. Over 1.5 hour wait, ordered wings and a new Yorker and theres no blue cheese even though it says it comes with the wings. Can't even get on the phone with them to complain. This place is overrated."
0,0,when i put the salad in my mouth i felt i am eating sand as it was not washed...pathetic....the waitress are so rude that they will come once if u will call 3 to 4 times...overall pathetic...and its so pricey also....
0,0,"Rude, long waits, food sub par."
1,0,"Have been many times, usually pre or post game at the urging of son. Has continued to worsen to the point of this review. The restaurant is so dirty that one wonders how they pass health inspections. Service is slow, unfriendly and barely competent. Last straw came this weekend when I was served my pizza which was a combination of two pizzas. Part or all of which was a leftover (see pic). Two slices were reheated and added to rest of pizza. Disgusting, unacceptable and reprehensible. Never again. Ciao"
0,0,"Our first visit to Atlantic Fish was a wonderful experience! We returned a year later and to our dismay, the two entries, fish and chips, and swordfish were rather cold and soggy. At the time, we were celebratking our 30th anniversary. Even though Atlantic Fish is known for its excellence, some meals are not so great."
0,0,Toilets disgusting. Doesn‚Äôt bode well for the state of the kitchen. Frosty reception from the staff.
0,0,"Another awful place run by miserable people with no aloha. The hostess/waitress literally stopped in the middle of taking my order to go yell at a couple taking selfies that photography wasn't allowed on their property. I should have walked away then.I had a latte and a breakfast burrito. The burrito was decent, the latte was undrinkable so I just left it. On walking out the same lady told me to clear my table and pointed to their dirty dishes table. I smiled at her and left. The views were awesome as this place is right on the water, but everything else blows."
1,1,Great breakfast. Eggs benedict at the airport but JO diner was definetely better. Fresh and everything‚Äôs bade from scratch. Had a kale smoothie which was refreshing and great start of a day. Highly recommend.
0,0,"We waited in line for about 50 minutes, and as a result, we encountered a breakfast not worth what we expected. I never recommend it."
0,0,The starters were bland and the main dishes tasteless. This is probably the worse Indian I have had abroad and I have 2 a week so I know my curries. Avoid if you can and wait until you get home. Waste of money. 
1,1,Light & Tasty Indian Dinner
1,1,"The service was extremely fast. My only complaint was the place was loud, crammed and a little too fast. I shared chicken Pad Thai with my son, which was plenty food. My other son had Sesame Chicken. Food was very good and reasonably priced."
1,1,"We went to the City Diner simply because it was close, but found out that it's clearly a hidden gem. We loved our dinner and would absolutely visit again. Great food, great atmosphere, tremendous service"
1,1,"Most authentic taste I tried in Poland. Tasty, juicy, fresh, home made. Tried several different types, oven, boiled, Polish, Russian, Georgian. All delicious, winners were the Georgians. I did not try the sweet ones. Price excellent. Not much waiting time after 9. Highly recommended"
1,1,"Our family went to Clyde's for lunch, and the manager and servers were all kind and very aware of cross contamination issues and told us they take food allergies very seriously there (and at the other Clyde's-owned restaurants). They were able to accommodate my daughter, who has a peanut allergy. FYI, they do have peanut butter on the kid's menu, but offer a sun butter alternative. My daughter had their kid's menu cheese pizza, which came with salad, fruit and a juice. Her food, as well as ours, was delicious. Would definitely go back again. "
2,1,Lovely staff so friendly all dishes are excellent and service was very efficient with no difficulty or confusion
0,0,"Honestly , it‚Äôs not worth it. I went there to celebrate my 1st Anniversary and they did not have anything spl to offer on your spl days."
0,0,Came here on a girls night and the service was horrible. We waited for far to long and the food was not worth the price. I would give no star but you can't. Your better off going somewhere else. Don't waste your time or money!
1,1,"Tucked away in a neat little corner, I wasn't expecting such excellent food. Healthy, tasty, and well presented"
-1,1,"Dede, Baltimore: This chef‚Äôs food is always a joy to eat, but I expected more ..."
1,1,Food and service were excellent. We had the vegetarian sharing menu - fantastic flavour combinations throughout. Inspired to visit Israel now!
0,0,"This restaurant is very mediocre. It seems as if almost the ambiance is supposed to make up for the quality of the food and lack of customer service. I cannot even begin to explain how cold the Tuscan meatballs were and how undercooked the anticucho steak skewers were. Just to name a few dishes. The food is highly overpriced, especially for such shitty quality. The servers seem to talk constantly and don't actually ""care"" about the restaurant but more so what's going on on their iPhone or in their personal lives. ¬†1/10 "
-1,0,"Great food, terrible service"
1,0,"We sat in our booth with two children crying because they were hungry. Waitress by waitress walking by. Our waitress who sat us down, had two locals come in and she immediately took their order. Still ignoring us. We sat for 25 minutes, no drinks, no service, no nothing. We got up and left! Then this waitress had the nerve to say, ""Oh I guess the kids aren't cooperating today!"" REALLY? ********TERRIBLE SERVICE**********"
1,1,Very good food! Always nice and friendly. One of my favorite indian restaurants in G√∂teborg!
0,0,Looked up to reviews for this restaurant which appeared to show it was top rated. Ordered Chicken Balti and roti. Chicken was very tough and roti's cold and tasteless. Balti full of chopped onion and foul. Avoid the place like the plague. Service already included in meal. Waste of money and very bad food.
0,0,Uninterested service. Not customer oriented at all.

0,0,"The maitre d' refused to seat us on March 25 2022 at 8:15, claiming that there was a large party coming later, despite plenty of empty seats. After an hour, I happened to walk past and it was still completely empty. See attached photos. Clearly, the staff here are just lazy."
1,1,stopped at the red lobster for dinner I was seated and ordered the feast with a lobster tail grilled scallops and shrimp scampi and walts shrimp everything was tasty and delicious
1,1,"Restaurant Jin Xuan has become a habit of mine. Every time I come back to Shanghai, I always come here for Brunch or Afternoon Tea. They serve classic Cantonese Dim Sum with panache, making every dish to order. "
1,1,"Really enjoyed our meal here. Trendy/hipster restaurant. The vegan pizza and the cauliflower burger were really tasty. Bit pricey, but the food and service was good. I would visit again."
1,1,"¬†But this the the first time I felt inspired to write a review of my dining experience. ""Forest and Plate"" is absolutely remarkable."
